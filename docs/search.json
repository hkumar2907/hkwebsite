    "text": "• Preprocessing of publicly available RNA and microRNA array (Affymetrix chip) data for differential expression analysis; utilizing rank product methodology and gene networks\n• Overexpressing microRNAs in cell lines through lentiviral transfection\n• Measuring changes in EGFR pathway activity (RNAseq, qPCR, and western blots)\n\n\n\n• Wearable sensors can improve patient experience. We applied machine learning and topological data analysis to the WISDM activity dataset. Specifically, I focused on preprocessing the time-series data and implementing supervised classification for activity recognition. We are working on preparing this work for journal submission, by the end of this year.\n• Continuous monitoring has proven to be more effective in detecting hypoxemia and hypotension in post-surgery patients. Using gaussian and Markov chain models, we categorized patients into distinct oxygenation states based on continuous SPO2 data from a collaborative study.\n\n\n\n• For TSC patients, a clear genotype-phenotype correlation over a patient’s life is still lacking. This hinders the development of targeted therapies and prognoses. We conducted phenotypic clustering analysis on data from the largest repository of clearly identified and well-studied individuals with TSC (N = 947, TSC Alliance Natural History Database).\n• This revealed four phenotypes and domain-specific TSC1/TSC2 variant associations.\n\n\n\n• Glioblastoma treatment with TMZ often leads to resistance. We investigated how glioblastoma cells evolve chemoresistance to TMZ using a clinically relevant dosing regimen, showing a gradual increase in resistance over multiple treatment cycles."

    "text": "Project: Defining a core NRF2 gene set\n• The NRF2 pathway plays a key role in oxidative stress response; we explored its activation in human cancers through KEAP1 inhibition and associated NRF2/KEAP1 mutations. I analyzed 7 RNA-seq databases to identify 14 consistently upregulated genes. We then validated these findings in other publicly available datasets."

This involved assigning clinical scores to the mice everyday by looking at weight changes, posture, activity level, fur texture etc."

Initially, I started with a feed forward network, however I soon transitioned to a Long Short-Term memory network to better capture the temporal dependencies.\n• I optimized the network by adjusting neurons, learning rate, epochs, and preprocessing."

I have a background in Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, and Biology.\nMy research focuses on leveraging computational and experimental approaches to develop cancer therapeutics. I have primarily focused on identifying microRNA-based therapeutic targets in glioblastoma by computationally optimizing microRNA combinations to regulate EGFR activity and validating their effects in vitro. I have also worked on analyzing patient time-series data using machine learning.\nPassionate about mentorship and collaboration, I aim to advance integrative strategies in cancer research and bridge computational biology with clinical applications."
